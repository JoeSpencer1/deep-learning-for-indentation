# Extraction of mechanical properties of materials through deep learning from instrumented indentation

## Description

This is my copy of the repository located at https://github.com/lululxvi/deep-learning-for-indentation. I have reorganized it and added comments to explain it and find how it could be adapted to find the results of otehr factors like temperature.

Having a duplicate repository will allow me to work on the code locally on any computer. Learning how to make and edit README files will also help me in future GitHub repositories I create.

## Paper

The data and code for the paper [L. Lu, M. Dao, P. Kumar, U. Ramamurty, G. E. Karniadakis, & S. Suresh. Extraction of mechanical properties of materials through deep learning from instrumented indentation. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 117(13), 7052-7062, 2020](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/03/13/1922210117).

## Data

All the data is in the folder [data](data).

## Code

All the code is in the folder [src](src). The code depends on the deep learning package [DeepXDE](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde) v1.1.2. If you use DeepXDE>1.1.2, you need to set `standardize=True` in `dde.data.MfDataSet()`.

- [data.py](src/data.py): The classes are used to read the data file. Remember to uncomment certain line in `ExpData` to scale `dP/dh`.
- [nn.py](src/nn.py): The main functions of multi-fidelity neural networks.
- [model.py](src/model.py): The fitting function method. Some parameters are hard-coded in the code, and you should modify them for different cases.
- [fit_n.py](src/fit_n.py): Fit strain-hardening exponent.
- [mfgp.py](src/mfgp.py): Multi-fidelity Gaussian process regression.
